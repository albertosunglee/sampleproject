# Metadata Deployment Order Fix

## Issues Fixed âœ…

1. **XML Declarations**: Removed extra spaces from all XML declarations
2. **CustomTab Structure**: Fixed `customObject` boolean and added `sObjectType`
3. **Validation Errors**: All linter errors resolved

## Remaining Issue: PermissionSet Object Reference

**Error**: `In field: object - no CustomObject named Project__c found`

**Cause**: PermissionSets are trying to reference `Project__c` before it's fully deployed and recognized by the org.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Split Deployment (Recommended)

Deploy in two phases to ensure proper order:

#### Phase 1: Deploy Object Only

Temporarily remove PermissionSets from deployment:

```bash
# Move PermissionSets out of the way temporarily
mkdir temp-permissionsets
mv force-app/main/default/permissionsets/Project_*.xml temp-permissionsets/

# Deploy object first
git add .
git commit -m "Phase 1: Deploy Project object and tab"
git push origin UAT
```

#### Phase 2: Deploy PermissionSets

After successful object deployment:

```bash
# Move PermissionSets back
mv temp-permissionsets/Project_*.xml force-app/main/default/permissionsets/

# Deploy PermissionSets
git add .
git commit -m "Phase 2: Deploy Project PermissionSets"
git push origin UAT
```

### Option 2: Single Deployment with Minimal PermissionSets

Create simpler PermissionSets that deploy successfully, then enhance them later.

### Option 3: Use Deployment Manifest Order

Create a specific deployment manifest that ensures proper order.
